title: improve my thinking
---
Everyone can improve their thinking. the best way is to jot them down, create an outline, add items and sub-items, nest through them, now add details, and more content into each item and finally when you capture everything, refine it into a better structure for readability. and here comes the best part: share it with others and ask for reviews. address the comments and reviews and voila! you now have bumped the version of your thinking on the subject by one major version.
